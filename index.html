    <a id="link" target="_blank">Click ctrl+r to look up 30 random sequences of letters at once, or click this link to open up one tab. If it doesn't work, then make sure that pop-ups are allowed!</a>
    <p>When you use this, it will open up 30 tabs at once, all with a random search in which every letter of the alphabet is shuffles. I would list all the possible options for you, but there are 3628800, or 3 billion six hundred twenty eight thousand eight hundred. Here's a couple examples below:<br>i,l,p,v,t,m,c,j,e,r,a,z,g,x,s,y,u,f,d,b,w,h,q,n,k,o<br>d,p,l,t,c,f,e,m,q,w,h,r,j,v,y,u,k,g,z,n,i,b,a,x,s,o<br>y,s,p,o,w,v,g,m,x,q,u,a,l,h,e,r,b,j,d,n,z,f,c,i,t,k<br>Thiscan be used to open 30 tabs on bing and get paid 15 cents by only clicking a couple buttons.<br>You may be worried that it will do two of the same tab, and then bing won't pay you as much, and you'll have to do this again. Don't worry. The chances of that happening are 1/13168189440000. And if you have lived for enough days to get to that, then you're 36 billion years old, and have gotten over 5 trillion dollars through this method. So if you have gotten that much, and you're somehow that old, it's safe to say that half of a cent won't matter, nore will a billion dallars. Have fun!</p>
